        At Pleiades, we charge a fair price for our services. The complexity of
        online marketing is often intentionally exaggerated by agencies offering
        SEO and SEM services â€” we don't do that. Our monthly reports tell you
        everything that we're doing and how it works, so that you can be a part
        of the process.

      <p class="text-1">
        When designing websites and apps, we're happy to work with your budget
        and your needs, whether that's creating a work of art online or giving
        you something quick and clean that you can run yourself.

        effectively communicates their brand and meets the needs of their target
        audience.

        This means two things: the first is that the web is a place of constant
        change, where trends, styles, and technologies become outdated. Many
        companies are willing to sell a website that never changes, but if you
        are subscribed to any of our web-service programs, we'll make sure your
        website never looks outdated and make minor changes whenever you want at
        no extra charge.
      </p>
      <p class="text-1">
        The second part of this is that we talk to you every step of the way in
        designing both websites and online strategies. And if somehow you don't
        like what we've made for you, we'll fix it for free.
