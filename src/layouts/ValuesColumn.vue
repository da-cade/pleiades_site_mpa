          At Pleiades, we charge a fair price for our services. The complexity
          of online marketing is often intentionally exaggerated by agencies
          offering SEO and SEM services â€” we don't do that. Our monthly reports
          tell you everything that we're doing and how it works, so that you can
          be a part of the process.

          This means two things: the first is that the web is a place of
          constant change, where trends, styles, and technologies become
          outdated. Many companies are willing to sell a website that never
          changes, but if you are subscribed to any of our web-service programs,
          we'll make sure your website never looks outdated and make minor
          changes whenever you want at no extra charge.
        </p>
        <p class="text-1">
          The second part of this is that we talk to you every step of the way
          in designing both websites and online strategies. And if somehow you
          don't like what we've made for you, we'll fix it for free.
